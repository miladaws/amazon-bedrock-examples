{"prompt": "Postmenopausal osteoporosis is a common chronic medical illness resulting from an imbalance between bone resorption and bone formation along with microarchitecture degeneration attributed to estrogen deficiency and often accompanied by other medical conditions such as weight gain, depression, and insomnia. Semaglutide (SEM) is a recently introduced GLP-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) for the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus by mitigating insulin resistance. It has been discovered that the beneficial effects of GLP-1 are associated with alterations in lipolysis, adipogenesis, and anti-inflammatory processes. GLP-1 analogs transmit signals directly to adipose tissue. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multidisciplinary cells that originate from bone marrow, migrate to injury sites, and promote bone regeneration. MSCs can differentiate into osteoblasts, adipose cells, and cartilage cells. Our aim is to investigate the role of semaglutide on bone formation and the Wnt signaling pathway. Osteoporosis was induced in female rats by ovariectomy, and the ovariectomized rats were treated with alendronate as standard treatment with a dose of 3&#xa0;mg/kg orally and semaglutide with two doses (150 mcg/kg and 300 mcg/kg) S.C. for 10 successive weeks. Semaglutide ameliorates bone detrimental changes induced by ovariectomy. It improves bone microarchitecture and preserves bone mineral content. Semaglutide ameliorates ovariectomy-induced osteoporosis and increases the expression of &#x3b2;-catenin, leading to increased bone formation and halted receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-&#x392; ligand (RANKL's) activation. Semaglutide can be used as a potential prophylactic and therapeutic drug against osteoporosis, possibly by activating Wnt signaling and decreasing bone resorption.", "completion": "Summarized abstract"}

{"prompt": "Diabetes is a metabolic condition characterized by high blood glucose levels. Aquatic products like microalgae, bacteria, seagrasses, macroalgae, corals, and sponges have been investigated for potential anti-diabetic properties. We looked at polyphenols, peptides, pigments, and sterols, as well as other bioactive substances found in marine resources, to see if they could help treat or manage diabetes, in addition to describing the several treatment strategies that alter diabetes and its implications, such as inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphatases 1B (PTP1B), &#x3b1;-glucosidase, &#x3b1;-amylase, dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV), aldose reductase, lipase, glycogen synthase kinase 3&#x3b2; (GSK-3&#x3b2;), and insulin resistance prevention, promotion of liver antioxidant capacity, natural killer cell stimulant, anti-inflammatory actions, increased AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation and sugar and metabolism of the lipid, reducing oxidative stress, and &#x3b2;-pancreatic cell prevention. This study highlights the revolutionary potential of marine bioactive compounds and microorganisms in transforming diabetes care. We believe in a future in which innovative, sustainable, and efficient therapeutic approaches will result in improved quality of life and better outcomes for people with diabetes mellitus by forging a new path for treatment, utilizing the power of the world's oceans, and capitalizing on the symbiotic relationship between humans and the marine ecosystem.

{"prompt": "Obesity has been identified as a rapidly rising pandemic within the developed world, potentially increasing the risks of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Various studies have identified a positive association between stress, elevated cortisol levels and obesity. Mechanisms of the stress response lead to hyperpalatable food preference and increased appetite through the activation of the HPA axis, elevated cortisol and the resulting interactions with the dopaminergic system, neuropeptide Y, ghrelin, leptin and insulin. The methodology of this review involved a Systematic Search of the Literature with a Critical Appraisal of papers considering ashwagandha, mediation and mindfulness in relation to mechanisms of the stress response. It incorporated 12 searches yielding 330 hits. A total of 51 studies met the inclusion criteria and were critically appraised with ARRIVE, SIGN50 and Strobe checklists. Data from the 51 studies was extracted, coded into key themes and summarized in a narrative analysis. Thematic analysis identified 4&#x2009;key themes related to ashwagandha and 2&#x2009;key themes related to meditation. Results provide an overview of evidence assessing the efficacy of ashwagandha and meditation in relation to weight loss interventions by supporting the stress response and the pathways highlighted. Results of Clinical studies indicate that ashwagandha supports weight loss through reduced stress, cortisol and food cravings. Pre-clinical studies also suggest that ashwagandha possesses the capacity to regulate food intake by improving leptin and insulin sensitivity and reducing addictive behaviors through dopamine regulation. Clinical studies on meditation indicate it may enhance a weight loss protocol by reducing the stress response, cortisol release and blood glucose and improving eating behaviors.", "completion": "Summarized abstract"}

{"prompt": "Low socioeconomic position (SEP) has been identified as a risk factor for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and psychosocial resources might be on the pathway in this association. We examined two poor psychosocial resources, low control beliefs and inferiority beliefs, that might link low SEP with T2DM. 8292 participants aged 40-75 living in Southern Netherlands participated in The Maastricht Study starting from September 2010 to October 2020 and were followed up to 10&#x2009;years with annual questionnaires. SEP (education, income, occupation), low control beliefs, inferiority beliefs, and (pre)diabetes by oral glucose tolerance test were measured at baseline. Incident T2DM was self-reported per annum. We analysed the mediating roles of poor psychosocial resources by using counterfactual mediation analysis. People with low SEP had more often prevalent and incident T2DM (e.g. low education: HR&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.13, 95%CI: 1.53-2.97). Low control beliefs and high inferiority beliefs were more common among people with low SEP. Moreover, low control beliefs and high inferiority beliefs were risk factors for T2DM (e.g. low control beliefs: HR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.50, 95%CI: 1.08-2.09). The relationship between SEP and T2DM was partially mediated by control beliefs (8.0-13.6%) and inferiority beliefs (2.2-4.5%). We conclude that poor psychosocial resources are important in socioeconomic inequalities in diabetes. Researchers and practitioners should consider the psychosocial profile of people with lower SEP, as such a profile might interfere with the development, treatment, and prevention of T2DM. Further research should explore how poor psychosocial resources interact with chronic stress in relation to socioeconomic health inequalities.", "completion": "Summarized abstract"}

{"prompt": "Exenatide (Ex4), a GLP-1 incretin mimetic polypeptide, is an effective therapeutic agent against diabetes and obesity. We highlight the indirect role of Ex4's structure-stabilizing Trp-cage (Tc) motif in governing GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) signal transduction. We use various Ex4 derivatives to explore how Tc compactness influences thermal stability, aggregation, enhancement of insulin secretion, and GLP-1R binding. We found that Ex4 variants decorated with fortified Tc motifs exhibit increased resistance to unfolding and aggregation but show an inverse relationship between the bioactivity and stability. Molecular dynamics simulations coupled with a rigid-body segmentation protocol to analyze dynamic interconnectedness revealed that the constrained Tc motifs remain intact within the receptor-ligand complexes but interfere with one of the major stabilizing contacts and recognition loci on the extracellular side of GLP-1R, dislodging the N-terminal activating region of the hormone mimetics, and restrict the free movement of TM6, the main signal transduction device of GLP-1R.", "completion": "Summarized abstract"}

{"prompt": "Medical modulation of sex hormone levels is a cornerstone of treatment for many conditions that impact well-being, including cancer, fertility/infertility, gender dysphoria, and chronic metabolic diseases such as diabetes and obesity. The microbial residents of the intestine, known as the microbiota, interact with sex hormones in the intestine, and there is correlative evidence that this interaction is bidirectional. Based on these published findings, we hypothesized that transgender individuals receiving exogenous testosterone as part of their gender-affirming medical treatment might undergo changes in their intestinal microbiome. To test this, we collected 26 stool samples from nine individuals before and up to 8 months after initiation of treatment with exogenous testosterone and subjected these samples to metagenomic analysis. While no species were significantly associated with the duration of testosterone therapy, pathways that generate glutamate increased in abundance, while those that consume glutamate decreased. Glutamate is a precursor of arginine, and testosterone is known to increase levels of arginine and its metabolites in the plasma. We hypothesize that testosterone increases the uptake of glutamate by enterocytes, thus decreasing access of the microbiota to this amino acid. While this pilot study establishes the impact of testosterone therapy on the intestinal microbiome, a more comprehensive study is necessary to establish the impact of testosterone-driven metagenomic shifts on the stool metatranscriptome, the stool metabolome, and the plasma metabolome.IMPORTANCEThe human intestine is inhabited by a large community of microbes known as the microbiome. Members of the microbiome consume the diet along with their human host. Thus, the metabolomes of the host and microbe are intricately linked. Testosterone alters the plasma metabolome. In particular, plasma levels of arginine and its metabolites and testosterone are positively correlated. To investigate the impact of exogenous testosterone on the microbiome, we analyzed the stool metagenomes of transgender individuals before and after the initiation of testosterone treatment. In this pilot project, we found a modest impact on the microbiome community structure but an increase in the abundance of metabolic pathways that generate glutamate and spare glutamate consumption. We propose that the host uses glutamate to generate arginine, decreasing the amount available for the microbiome.", "completion": "Summarized abstract"}
{"prompt": "HIV-associated neurocognitive impairment (HIV-NCI) affects 15%-50% of people with HIV (PWH), despite viral suppression with antiretroviral therapy (ART). HIV neuropathogenesis is mediated, in part, by transmigration of infected CD14+CD16+ monocytes across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) into the central nervous system (CNS). In the CNS, CD14+CD16+ monocytes contribute to infection and activation of parenchymal cells, resulting in production of neurotoxic viral and host factors that cause neuronal damage. Mechanisms by which CD14+CD16+ monocytes contribute to HIV-NCI have not been characterized in a study population of PWH on ART without contribution from confounders that affect cognition (e.g., substance use, hepatitis C virus coinfection). We assessed cognitive function, PBMC transmigration across the BBB, and neuronal health markers in a well-defined cohort of 56 PWH on ART using stringent criteria to eliminate confounding factors. We demonstrated that PWH on ART with HIV-NCI have significantly increased transmigration of their CD14+CD16+ monocytes across the BBB compared with those with normal cognition. We showed that hypertension and diabetes may be effect modifiers on the association between CD14+CD16+ monocyte transmigration and cognition. This study underscored the persistent role of CD14+CD16+ monocytes in HIV-NCI, even in PWH with viral suppression, suggesting them as potential targets for therapeutic interventions.", "completion": "Summarized abstract"}
{"prompt": "Sarcopenic obesity is the co-existence of obesity and sarcopenia in individuals aged 40-75&#x2009;years. The Japanese Working Group on Sarcopenic Obesity has developed diagnostic criteria tailored for the Japanese population, considering their unique characteristics compared with European populations. Our algorithm consists of two steps: screening and diagnosis. The screening of obesity mandates using waist circumference and/or body mass index (BMI) based on national standards, while screening for sarcopenia involves the \"finger ring test\" in addition to the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia 2019 criteria. The final diagnosis of sarcopenia involves handgrip strength for low muscle strength, the five-times chair stand test for low physical function, and limb skeletal muscle mass (corrected for BMI) for low muscle mass. Obesity is assessed by visceral fat area or body fat percentage. Sarcopenic obesity is then categorized into Stage I, with muscle weakness/loss of function, loss of muscle mass, and obesity; or Stage II, which includes complications.

{"prompt": "Diabetes mellitus poses a significant health challenge globally, often leading to debilitating complications, such as neuropathy and retinopathy. Quercetin, a flavonoid prevalent in fruits and vegetables, has demonstrated potential therapeutic effects in these conditions due to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective properties. This review summarizes and provides a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the efficacy of quercetin in ameliorating diabetic neuropathy and retinopathy. A thorough search was carried out across scientific databases, such as SciFinder, PubMed, and Google Scholar, to gather pertinent literature regarding the effect of quercetin on diabetic neuropathy and retinopathy till February 2024. Preclinical studies indicate that quercetin mitigates neuropathic pain, sensory deficits, and nerve damage associated with diabetic neuropathy by improving neuronal function, reducing DNA damage, regulating pro-inflammatory cytokines, enhancing antioxidant enzyme levels and endothelial function, as well as restoring nerve injuries. In diabetic retinopathy, quercetin shows the potential to preserve retinal structure and function, inhibiting neovascularization, preventing retinal cell death, reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines, and increasing neurotrophic factor levels. Moreover, through modulating key signaling pathways, such as AMP-activated Protein Kinase (AMPK) activation, Glucose Transporter 4 (GLUT 4) upregulation, and insulin secretion regulation, quercetin demonstrates efficacy in reducing oxidative stress and inflammation, thereby protecting nerve and retinal tissues. Despite promising preclinical findings, challenges, such as limited bioavailability, necessitate further research to optimize quercetin's clinical application in order to establish its optimal dosage, formulation, and long-term efficacy in clinical settings.", "completion": "Summarized abstract"}
{"prompt": "Marine organisms represent promising bioactive peptide resources with diverse biological activities such as antioxidant, antimicrobial, antihypertensive, anti-fatigue, and immunoregulatory activities. Despite many studies on marine bioactive peptides, there is a dearth of comprehensive review articles on the emerging trends that encompass the production techniques and the biological applications of marine bioactive peptides. In this review, we summarize the major research and findings related to marine bioactive peptides, encompassing aspects of their production, purification, biological activities, nanotechnology-based strategies, and their potential applications. Enzymatic hydrolysis currently stands out as the most commonly used method for producing marine bioactive peptides; the downstream purification process often includes a combination of multiple purification techniques. Due to their diverse biological properties, marine peptides have garnered considerable interest for industrial applications as active ingredients in the food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetics industries. Additionally, the incorporation of encapsulation strategies such as nano emulsion, nanoliposome, and microemulsions holds promise for significantly enhancing the bioavailability and bioactivity of marine peptides. Future research should also prioritize the systematic identification and validation of the potential health benefits of marine peptides by both in vitro and in vivo animal models, along with the conduct of human clinical trials.", "completion": "Summarized abstract"}
{"prompt": "Central insulin resistance has been linked to the development of neurodegenerative diseases and mood disorders. Various proteins belonging to the enzyme family of protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) act as inhibitors of insulin signaling. Protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type J (PTPRJ) has been identified as a negative regulator in insulin signaling in the periphery. However, the impact of PTPRJ on insulin signaling and its functional role in neuronal cells is largely unknown. Therefore, we generated a Ptprj knockout (KO) cell model in the murine neuroblast cell line Neuro2a by CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing. Ptprj KO cells displayed enhanced insulin signaling, as shown by increased phosphorylation of the insulin receptor (INSR), IRS-1, AKT, and ERK1/2. Further, proximity ligation assays (PLA) revealed both direct interaction of PTPRJ with the INSR and recruitment of this phosphatase to the receptor upon insulin stimulation. By RNA sequencing gene expression analysis, we identified multiple gene clusters responsible for glucose uptake and metabolism, and genes involved in the synthesis of various lipids being mainly upregulated under PTPRJ deficiency. Furthermore, multiple Ca<sup>2+</sup> transporters were differentially expressed along with decreased protein biosynthesis. This was accompanied by an increase in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers. On a functional level, PTPRJ deficiency compromised cell differentiation and neurite outgrowth, suggesting a role in nervous system development. Taken together, PTPRJ emerges as a negative regulator of central insulin signaling, impacting neuronal metabolism and neurite outgrowth.", "completion": "Summarized abstract"}

FGF21 and another endocrine FGF, fibroblast growth factor 15/19 (FGF15/19), signal to target tissues by binding to the co-receptor &#x3b2;-klotho (KLB), which then facilitates the interaction of these different FGFs with their preferred FGF receptor. KLB is expressed in multiple metabolic tissues, but the specific cell types and spatial distribution of these cells are not known. Furthermore, while circulating FGF21 is primarily produced by the liver, recent publications have indicated that brain derived FGF21 impacts memory and learning.

{"prompt": "Matcha shows promise for diabetes, obesity, and gut microbiota disorders. Studies suggest a significant link between gut microbiota, metabolites, and obesity. Thus, matcha may have a positive impact on obesity by modulating gut microbiota and metabolites. This study used 16S rDNA sequencing and untargeted metabolomics to examine the cecal contents in mice. By correlation analysis, we explored the potential mechanisms responsible for the positive effects of matcha on obesity. The results indicated that matcha had a mitigating effect on the detrimental impacts of a high-fat diet (HFD) on multiple physiological indicators in mice, including body weight, adipose tissue weight, serum total cholesterol (TC), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, as well as glucose tolerance. Moreover, it was observed that matcha had an impact on the structural composition of gut microbiota and gut metabolites. Specifically, matcha was able to reverse the alterations in the abundance of certain obesity-improving bacteria, such as <i>Alloprevotella</i>, <i>Ileibacterium</i>, and <i>Rikenella</i>, as well as the abundance of obesity-promoting bacteria <i>Romboutsia</i>, induced by a HFD. Furthermore, matcha can influence the levels of metabolites, including formononetin, glutamic acid, pyroglutamic acid, and taurochenodeoxycholate, within the gastrointestinal tract. Additionally, matcha enhances caffeine metabolism and the HIF-1 signaling pathway in the KEGG pathway. The results of the correlation analysis suggest that formononetin, theobromine, 1,3,7-trimethyluric acid, and Vitamin C displayed negative correlation with both the obesity phenotype and microbiota known to exacerbate obesity, while demonstrating positive correlations with microbiota that alleviated obesity. However, glutamic acid, pyroglutamic acid, and taurochenodeoxycholate had the opposite effect. In conclusion, the impact of matcha on gut metabolites may be attributed to its modulation of the abundance of <i>Alloprevotella</i>, <i>Ileibacterium</i>, <i>Rikenella</i>, and <i>Romboutsia</i> within the gastrointestinal tract, thereby potentially contributing to the amelioration of obesity.", "completion": "Summarized abstract"}

{"prompt": "Testosterone's biological functions are extensive, influencing reproductive and systemic health. It plays a vital role in sexual functions, muscle protein synthesis, bone metabolism, fat distribution, and cardiovascular health. The hormone also affects mood, cognitive function, and erythropoiesis, underscoring its importance in both physical and mental health. Testosterone deficiency, or male male hypogonadism, is increasingly recognized as a significant health issue affecting various bodily systems, also in the context of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Recent research indicates a complex interplay between testosterone levels and renal health, suggesting that male male hypogonadism may both impact and be impacted by CKD. The latter is characterized by a gradual loss of kidney function, affects millions globally and is often associated with diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension, and autoimmune diseases. Men with CKD frequently experience lower testosterone levels, which can exacerbate muscle wasting, reduce quality of life, and increase cardiovascular risk. Overall, low testosterone levels in CKD patients are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Several mechanisms explain the relationship between CKD and testosterone deficiency. The uremic environment in CKD disrupts the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, impairing hormone production. Nutritional deficiencies and chronic inflammation common in CKD patients further suppress gonadal function. The consequences of low testosterone in CKD are profound, with studies suggesting that testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) might improve clinical outcomes, though the long-term effects and causal relationships remain under investigation. The potential benefits of TRT in CKD patients might be significant. TRT can enhance muscle mass and strength, address anemia by stimulating erythropoiesis, improve bone density, and possibly offer cardiovascular benefits by improving body composition and insulin sensitivity. General symptoms of male hypogonadism, such as deteriorated psychological, sexual and physical wellbeing, can be improved by TRT. However, these benefits must be weighed against potential risks. TRT may exacerbate fluid retention, arterial hypertension, or exacerbate existing heart failure, particularly in CKD patients with pre-existing cardiovascular comorbidities. Additionally, concerns about the progression of renal disease via several testosterone affected pathways involving renal tubular integrity exist, highlighting the need for careful patient selection and monitoring. Understanding this relationship is crucial for developing comprehensive treatment strategies that address both renal and endocrine dysfunctions, highlighting the need for integrated patient care, which means good collaboration between subspecialists like nephrologists, endocrinologists, urologists and primary care providers, aiming to improve outcomes and quality of life while mitigating adverse effects.", "completion": "Summarized abstract"}
{"prompt": "Bone fragility is a recognized complication of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), increasing patient morbidity. Thus, the development of an effective intervention to prevent diabetic bone fragility is urgently needed. As lifestyle intervention represents an effective option for diabetes management, it may have an impact on bone health. While studies have shown a beneficial effect of dietary fiber in T2DM management, its effect on bone health is still unclear. Thus, we investigated the impact of a high-fiber diet on bone and glucose control in men and women with T2DM. Forty-five T2DM patients (HbA1c: 6.5%&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.49%, age: 74&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;7.29&#xa0;yr) scheduled for hip arthroplasty were randomly assigned to follow a high-fiber diet (38&#xa0;g/day) or to make no diet changes for 12&#xa0;wk. Interestingly, BMI decreased by 4% (<i>p</i> &lt;.0001) and HbA1c by 3.4% (<i>p</i> &lt;.0001) in the high-fiber diet group, but did not decrease in the control group. However, serum concentration of the bone formation marker procollagen type 1 amino-terminal propeptide (P1NP) decreased by 8.6 % in the high-fiber diet group (<i>p</i> =.0004), whereas it remained unchanged in the control group. In contrast, similar to the control group, serum concentration of the bone resorption marker C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX) concentrations did not change in the high-fiber diet group. Bone microCT analysis revealed no changes in trabecular and cortical bone parameters between the high-fiber diet and control groups. Similarly, real-time (RT)-PCR analysis in bone tissue showed no changes in the gene expression of Wnt pathway-related genes (Sost, Dkk-1, Wnt10b, and Lef-1), bone formation markers (Runx2, Col1a1, and Ocn), and inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, TNF-&#x3b1;, and IL-10) between the two groups. Our findings suggest that 12-wk high-fiber diet intervention improves metabolic outcomes in patients with T2DM. However, it may reduce bone formation without affecting bone microarchitecture or Wnt pathway regulation.", "completion": "Summarized abstract"}

{"prompt": "Type 2 diabetes (T2D) significantly increases the risk of vascular complications (12-32 %), which are a major cause of death (over 50 %) in T2D patients. In T2D, both endothelial (ET) and vascular smooth muscle (VSM) cells are impaired, which act as independent risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Thus, the question of this systematic review and meta-analysis is: Do ET-dependent and -independent VSM relaxation impair in T2D? We systematically searched PubMed and Scopus databases until March 2024; 44 eligible clinical trial studies (68, 16, 30, and 50 study arms for acetylcholine (ACh), methacholine (MTH), sodium nitroprusside (SNP), and glyceryl trinitrate (GTN)) published were included. ET-dependent VSM relaxation in response to ACh (overall ES = -28.9 %, 95 % CI: -35.2, -22.7; p&lt;0.001) and MTH (overall ES = -55.3 %, 95 % CI: -63.6, -47.1; p&lt;0.001) decreased in T2D patients compared to controls. ET-independent VSM relaxation in response to SNP (overall ES = -17.2 %, 95 % CI: -35.2, -22.7; p&lt;0.001) and GTN (overall ES = -63.2 %, 95 % CI: -81.0, -45.5; p&lt;0.001) decreased in T2D patients compared to controls. Our meta-analysis showed reductions in both ET-dependent (~40 %) and ET-independent (~25 %) VSM relaxation. The decrease was more pronounced for MTH (~55 %) compared to ACh (~30 %) and for GTN (~63 %) compared to SNP (~17 %). These findings suggest that dysfunction of both ET and VSM contributes to impaired VSM relaxation in T2D patients. See also the graphical abstract(Fig. 1).", "completion": "Summarized abstract"}
{"prompt": "Smoking is the most significant and modifiable risk factor for a range of conditions, including cancer, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Furthermore, it significantly reduces bone mass and increases the risk of fragility fractures due to its detrimental effects on bone metabolism and regeneration. Moreover, smoking is a known cause of chronic systemic inflammation, leading to an imbalance of cytokines. Comprehending the pathological mechanisms that underlie cytokine production and its impact on post-surgical healing is essential to prevent post-surgical complications. The present study recruited a total of 1144 patients, including 897 patients, among them non-smokers (<i>N = 413</i>), current smokers (<i>N = 201</i>) and ex-smokers (<i>N = 283</i>). Human proteome profiler arrays were used to screen for smoking-dependent differences in the serum cytokine and protein profiles, after matching samples for age, gender, body mass index (BMI), alcohol use, and diabetes risk. Cytokines and immune checkpoint proteins such as CD28, B7-1, MIG, TGF&#x3b2;2 and IL-1&#x3b1;/&#x3b2; were quantified by ELISA. Our study demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between smoking, the development of complications, the systemic immune inflammation index (SII) and cytokine/protein levels. We found that a comparison of non-smokers, former smokers, and active smokers in our study cohort did not exhibit significantly altered cytokine and protein serum levels although other studies reported differences between smokers and non-smokers. We were unable to identify single blood circulating markers that could predict complications in smokers after trauma. However, we found the ratio of women to men to be inverted between non-smokers and active smokers resulting in a ratio of 0.62 in smokers. Furthermore, we demonstrate a higher complication rate, longer hospitalizations and elevated SII values among smokers, indicating an involvement of the immune system.

Bulk RNA-sequencing analysis identified significant downregulation of Dab2 in high concentrations glucose treated primary mouse skin ECs, simulating hyperglycemic conditions in diabetes mellitus. In diabetic mice with a genetic EC deficiency of Dab2 angiogenesis was reduced <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> when compared with wild-type mice. Restoration of Dab2 expression by injected mRNA-containing lipid nanoparticles rescued impaired angiogenesis and wound healing in diabetic mice. At the same time, FoxM1 was downregulated in skin ECs subjected to high glucose conditions as determined by RNA-sequencing analysis. FoxM1 was found to bind to the Dab2 promoter, regulating its expression and influencing VEGFR2 signaling. The FoxM1 inhibitor FDI-6 reduced Dab2 expression and phosphorylation of VEGFR2. These findings indicate that restoring Dab2 expression through targeted therapies can enhance angiogenesis and wound repair in diabetes. To explore this therapeutic potential, we tested LyP-1-conjugated lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) containing Dab2 or control mRNAs to target ECs and found the former significantly improved wound healing and angiogenesis in diabetic mice. This study provides evidence of the crucial roles of Dab2 and FoxM1 in diabetic endothelial dysfunction and establishes targeted delivery as a promising treatment for diabetic vascular complications.", "completion": "Summarized abstract"}

{"prompt": "Implementing diabetes surveillance systems is paramount to mitigate the risk of incurring substantial medical expenses. Currently, blood glucose is measured by minimally invasive methods, which involve extracting a small blood sample and transmitting it to a blood glucose meter. This method is deemed discomforting for individuals who are undergoing it. The present study introduces an Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) system, which aims to create an intelligible machine capable of explaining expected outcomes and decision models. To this end, we analyze abnormal glucose levels by utilizing Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). In this regard, the glucose levels are acquired through the glucose oxidase (GOD) strips placed over the human body. Later, the signal data is converted to the spectrogram images, classified as low glucose, average glucose, and abnormal glucose levels. The labeled spectrogram images are then used to train the individualized monitoring model. The proposed XAI model to track real-time glucose levels uses the XAI-driven architecture in its feature processing. The model's effectiveness is evaluated by analyzing the performance of the proposed model and several evolutionary metrics used in the confusion matrix. The data revealed in the study demonstrate that the proposed model effectively identifies individuals with elevated glucose levels.", "completion": "Summarized abstract"}
{"prompt": "Due to concern regarding the consumption of high amount of sugar in diet and role of diet in combating overweigh and related disease, the aim of present study was to optimize a reduced calorie probiotic chocolate milk formula with suitable physicochemical properties.

The independent variables included inulin (2-8%), CSG (0.1-0.5&#xa0;%), stevia (50-100&#xa0;% replacement of sugar), and WPC (1-3%). The dependent variables were selected as viscosity, average particle size, sedimentation percentage, and general acceptance. Optimization done toward achieving the highest viscosity and general acceptance and the lowest sedimentation percentage and average particle size. The optimal conditions were found to be 7.99&#xa0;% inulin, 70&#xa0;% stevia, 0.34&#xa0;% CSG, and 1&#xa0;% WPC. Under these conditions, the viscosity, sedimentation percentage, average particle size, and general acceptance of the product were equal to 40.69&#xa0;mPa&#xa0;s, 2.2&#xa0;%, 434.221&#xa0;nm, and 5.1, respectively.

{"prompt": "Inflammatory diseases compromise a clinically common and diverse group of conditions, causing detrimental effects on body functions. Gasdermins (GSDM) are pore-forming proteins, playing pivotal roles in modulating inflammation. Belonging to the GSDM family, gasdermin D (GSDMD) actively mediates the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases by mechanistically regulating different forms of cell death, particularly pyroptosis, and cytokine release, in an inflammasome-dependent manner. Aberrant activation of GSDMD in different types of cells, such as immune cells, cardiovascular cells, pancreatic cells and hepatocytes, critically contributes to the persistent inflammation in different tissues and organs. The contributory role of GSDMD has been implicated in diabetes mellitus, liver diseases, cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Clinically, alterations in GSDMD levels are potentially indicative to the occurrence and severity of diseases. GSDMD inhibition might represent an attractive therapeutic direction to counteract the progression of inflammatory diseases, whereas a number of GSDMD inhibitors have been shown to restrain GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis through different mechanisms. This review discusses the current understanding and future perspectives on the role of GSDMD in the development of inflammatory diseases, as well as the clinical insights of GSDMD alterations, and therapeutic potential of GSDMD inhibitors against inflammatory diseases. Further investigation on the comprehensive role of GSDM shall deepen our understanding towards inflammation, opening up more diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities against inflammatory diseases.", "completion": "Summarized abstract"}

{"prompt": "Sedentary behaviour (SB) is associated with an increased risk of metabolic issues (negative effects on diabetes, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and waist circumference), cardiovascular diseases, increased risk of all-cause mortality and accelerated ageing of skeletal muscle power. The research on SB is relatively new, with much evidence regarding its negative health effects gathered within the last decade. Office workers exhibit pronounced sedentary habits, with studies indicating they can spend up to 82% of their working day sitting. To address this issue, workplaces are responsible for promoting physical activity and minimising SB among employees. In this context, one potential strategy for reducing SB and its associated risks could be implementing active breaks (ABs). ABs are defined as brief, structured periods of physical activity or exercise. This quasi-experimental pilot study aims to implement workplace ABs programme aimed at interrupting SB among the University of Bologna (Italy) workers, and it will include both intervention and control groups. The intervention group will participate in an 8-week ABs programme. The findings from this study could establish a robust basis for future large-scale research on the effectiveness of ABs interventions in workplace settings.", "completion": "Summarized abstract"}

{"prompt": "Castleman disease is a rare and atypical lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by diverse clinical manifestations. It has both unicentric and multicentric forms, the latter with further subdivisions, i.e., human herpesvirus 8-associated and idiopathic forms. The diagnosis of Castleman disease is often delayed, as it is rare, and because it shares clinical features with different autoimmune, inflammatory, and malignant lymphoproliferative disorders. The first-line treatment in unicentric form is mainly surgical, while in idiopathic Castleman disease, anti-interleukin-6 treatment is the therapy of choice. In virus-associated diseases, antiretroviral therapy and rituximab are recommended. In Hungary, only a few cases of Castleman disease have been published. This report presents our two&#xa0;decades of experience in the challenging diagnosis and management of this rare disorder, most properly underdiagnosed in Hungary. We provide insights into seven unicentric and five idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease cases, the latter ones especially highlighting the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges due to the variable and unique clinical features both of patients and diseases, e.g., bronchiolitis obliterans, stage IV diabetic renal failure, anti-HBc positivity, siltuximab treatment period, respectively.", "completion": "Summarized abstract"}

{"prompt": "Assessing oxidative stress is vital in managing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and its complications. This systematic review aims to identify the most important oxidative stress markers in T2DM patients and predict associated complications. A literature search was conducted from 2013 to 2023, focusing on case-control, cohort, cross-sectional, and randomized control trials. The included studies had open access and scientific methodologies for assessing oxidative stress markers, while the excluded studies were not published in English or lacked primary objectives related to oxidative stress markers and T2DM or its complications. The quality of eligible studies was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) for case-control, cohort, and cross-sectional studies and the Jadad Scale for RCTs. Eighteen studies were selected for the review and 25 potential markers like malondialdehyde (MDA), 11 thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and isoprostanes were found to be the most commonly used markers to assess oxidative stress in T2DM. These markers help to assess oxidative stress levels in T2DM individuals as well as correlate with diabetic complications. Therefore, assessment and understanding of the role of oxidative stress in T2DM pathophysiology are crucial for improving patient care and mitigating complications.", "completion": "Summarized abstract"}
{"prompt": "Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) is characterized by transient left ventricular dysfunction without obstructive coronary artery disease, often mimicking acute coronary syndrome. Its association with diabetes mellitus and arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation (AF), suggests potential shared pathophysiological mechanisms. We report the case of a 76-year-old woman with diabetes who developed sudden, severe chest pain and palpitations after cataract surgery. Initial EKG showed ST-segment elevation, and laboratory tests revealed elevated high-sensitivity troponin, inflammatory markers, and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Despite acute coronary syndrome symptoms, coronary angiography showed no significant obstruction. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed left ventricular apical akinesia and a moderately reduced ejection fraction. A cardiac MRI a month later demonstrated complete recovery of left ventricular function and spontaneous resolution of AF tachycardia. This case highlights a rare presentation of TTS in a diabetic patient with AF and DKA. The spontaneous resolution of AF and recovery of left ventricular function underscore the complex interplay between these conditions. Further research is needed to explore the mechanisms linking TTS with diabetes and AF to improve clinical management and outcomes.", "completion": "Summarized abstract"}
{"prompt": "Introduction The SARS-CoV-2 virus causes the highly contagious coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which most commonly manifests as severe acute respiratory syndrome. The virus is part of the Coronaroviridae family, a group of viruses that can cause various diseases, such as the common cold, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak of COVID-19 as a pandemic on March 11, 2020. On February 26, 2020, Romania confirmed the first case of COVID-19, initiating a series of challenges that negatively impacted the lives of thousands of people. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a disproportionate effect on patients at risk of kidney damage. Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at high risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and mortality associated with COVID-19. CKD is associated with pronounced immunodeficiency and represents a risk factor for contracting the infection, but also increases the risk of hospitalization, oxygen therapy, and prolonged treatments. The evidence regarding the management of patients with CKD undergoing renal replacement therapy (RRT) infected with SARS-CoV-2 is still misleading. While these are high-risk patients due to the presence of multiple comorbidities, especially cardiovascular, e.g., hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, but also diabetes, the question remains whether RRT itself is associated with a worse prognosis in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, although infections generally induce severe complications in patients with CKD and RRT. Methods This retrospective study aims to analyze the evolution of COVID-19 disease in patients with CKD, focusing on the association with some common comorbidities such as ischemic coronary disease (ICD), obesity, and diabetes. The study included 72 hemodialyzed patients; they were hospitalized between November 2020 and February 2021 at \"Sf. Ioan\" Clinical Emergency Hospital, Nephrology and Dialysis Clinic; peritoneal dialysis patients were excluded. Results Older age was found to be an important risk factor for death in hemodialyzed patients admitted with COVID-19 infection. Obese patients were found to be at greater risk of mortality. Discussion This study showed that there is a complex relationship between COVID-19 infection and increased mortality in patients with CKD associating ischemic coronary disease, obesity, and diabetes.", "completion": "Summarized abstract"}
{"prompt": "Skull base osteomyelitis (SBO) is a severe and uncommon infection that typically affects the skull base and may arise from undiagnosed otogenic or sinonasal infection. This case describes a rare presentation of SBO, accompanied by thrombosis of the bilateral internal carotid artery with neurological deficits in a resource-limited environment, illustrating diagnostic and management dilemmas. A male patient aged 40 years with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes presented with sudden onset loss of consciousness and worsening right-sided weakness. MRI studies revealed SBO with cerebral involvement with thrombosis in major cerebral arteries and multiple brain infarcts. After receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and supportive care shortly after admission, the patient developed septic shock and died two days after admission. The fast course of the disease in this case shows how severe SBO and its complications&#xa0;may be, calling for early diagnosis and intensive management of SBO, especially in diabetic patients. The fact that Staphylococcus epidermidis was established as a causative agent of disease in the absence of artificial heart valves or joints, it is becoming clear that there is a need to increase awareness of such rare pathogens, and probably new strategies for handling such infections should be developed. Additional research is required to elucidate the precise role of the pathogen and refine treatment approaches, especially for low-resource healthcare systems.", "completion": "Summarized abstract"}

{"prompt": "The healing of bone defects among diabetic patients presents a critical challenge due to the pathological microenvironment, characterized by hyperglycemia, excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and inflammation. Herein, multifunctional composite microspheres, termed GMAP are developed, using a microfluidic technique by incorporating Au@Pt nanoparticles (NPs) and GelMA hydrogel to modulate the diabetic microenvironment for promoting bone regeneration. The GMAP enables the sustained release of Au@Pt NPs, which function as bimetallic nanozymes with dual enzyme-like activities involving glucose oxidase and catalase. The synergistic effect allows for efficient glucose consumption and ROS elimination concurrently. Thus, the GMAP effectively protects the proliferation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) under adverse high-glucose conditions. Furthermore, it also promotes the osteogenic differentiation and paracrine capabilities of BMSCs, and subsequently inhibits inflammation and enhances angiogenesis. In vivo diabetic rats bone defect model, it is demonstrated that GMAP microspheres significantly improve bone regeneration, as verified by micro-computed tomography and histological examinations. This study provides a novel strategy for bone regeneration by modulating the diabetic microenvironment, presenting a promising approach for addressing the complex challenges associated with bone healing in diabetic patients.", "completion": "Summarized abstract"}
{"prompt": "Gut microbial metabolites have been demonstrated to play a role in diabetes mellitus and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). This study aimed to investigate gut microbiome, fecal metabolomics, and their association in pregnant women with and without GDM.

The increased Phenylalanylglycine, m-coumaric acid, and Phenylacetic acid were among the top differential metabolites between Con and GDM groups and involved in phenylalanine metabolism. Uracil and hypoxanthine were top differential metabolites in Con vs. GDM and involved in nucleotide metabolism. The proficiently altered gut microbiota at the class level was c_unclassified_ Firmicutes. Association analysis between gut microbiota and fecal metabolites indicated that the increased gut symbiont Clostridium belonged to Firmicutes and was linked to the dysregulation of phenylalanine metabolism in GDM.

{"prompt": "Diabetes is a complex disease, despite the availability of numerous treatments, its progression and complications can only be mitigated and managed to a certain extent. After the onset, diabetes cannot be reversed. Its global expansion makes it challenging for governments to control the considerable costs of treating people with diabetes. Many studies have been carried out by widely recognized pharmaceutical companies that are considering the development of new drugs for diabetic treatments. Diets, sedentary habits, and lifestyles that are currently prevalent have an enormous influence on the global spread of diabetes. The tools available to clinicians for therapy do not solve the problem. It is known that a patient, when diagnosed, would already have had diabetes for more than three years. Studies on diabetes signaling consider the effects of hyperglycemia but also highlight the roles of insulin receptor activation and resistance. Understanding the intricate signaling network and its interactions with hyperglycemiainduced pathways is crucial. In this context, the cyclic AMP/AMPK axis emerges as a promising therapeutic target for diabetes. However, there is a noticeable lack of literature exploring the metabolic network induced by hyperglycemia and its interconnected pathways. Therefore, investigating the cyclic cAMP/AMPK axis could provide valuable insights, given its complex connections with various metabolic pathways. This mini-review aims to delve into the metabolic signaling of the AMPK/cAMP axis in the context of diabetes, highlighting its metabolic interactions and potential implications.", "completion": "Summarized abstract"}

{"prompt": "BACKGROUND Obesity is suggested to impair the outcome after simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation, which affects survival, but the quantity and distribution of adipose tissue is not yet considered in obesity assessment. We aimed to evaluate the impact of body composition on outcome after simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation. MATERIAL AND METHODS We retrospectively analyzed data from 40 patients who underwent simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation due to type 1 diabetes mellitus with consecutive end-stage renal disease. Uni- and multivariate analyses, including donor's characteristics, were performed. RESULTS Only 6 (15%) recipients were obese. The incidence of postoperative complications was correlated with lower body fat proportion (p=0.03). This correlation remained significant in the multivariate analysis (p=0.015). Nevertheless, obesity was significantly associated with worse overall survival (p&lt;0.001). Visceral tissue proportion was correlated with a higher level of glycated hemoglobin in long-term follow-up (p=0.003). CONCLUSIONS Fat quantity and distribution should be included in the assessment of obesity. A protective effect of adipose tissue was detected on outcome after simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation in normosthenic recipients, but obesity still appears to have a negative effect on outcome after transplantation. Visceral fat distribution can promote de novo diabetes mellitus.", "completion": "Summarized abstract"}
